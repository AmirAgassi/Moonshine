 Game during the day, mine at night. Automatically.
 
# I do NOT support buying gaming GPU's to solely mine. This program is meant for gamers who already own GPU's to make a solid income with their silicon.

At current prices, your GPU can generate thousands of dollars of effort-free income every year. Though I can only give a rough estimate with cards I have personally tested, you can refer to the chart below for some context.

GPU | Income (monthly, USD) | Income (yearly, USD) | "MSRP" | Return on Investment Yearly (MSRP!)
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
RX 580 8GB | $77.775 | $933.3 | "$175" | 433%
RTX 3060ti 8GB | $165.92 | $1991.04 | "$399" | 399%
RTX 3080 10GB | $261.385 | $3136.62 | "$699" | 348%
