# Moonshine
 Game during the day, mine at night. Automatically.
 
# I do NOT support buying gaming GPU's to solely mine. This program is meant for gamers who already own GPU's to make a solid income with their silicon.

At current prices, your GPU can generate thousands of dollars of effort-free income every year. 
Though I can only give a rough estimate with cards I have personally tested, you can refer to the chart below for some context.

GPU | "MSRP" | Income (monthly, USD) | Income (yearly, USD) | Return on Investment Yearly (MSRP!)
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
RX 580 8GB | "$175" | $77.775 | $933.3 | 433%
RTX 3060ti 8GB | "$399" | $165.92 | $1991.04 | 399%
RTX 3080 10GB | "$699" | $261.385 | $3136.62 | 348%

Due to the fact gamers aren't playing video games 24/7, you can start mining automatically with your downtime (even while using your PC for other work/school!) and generate thousands of dollars per year. 

**The more we mine, the more money we take away from huge-scale mining operations that eat GPUs from gamers! And we make cash in the process!**

# Usage

If you aren't overclocking your card when mining, you're throwing away money through your power bill and profits alike. Advanced guides are easily found online, but for a reference, a list of NVIDIA cards and their "most common" overclocks with respective expected hashrates are shown below.
